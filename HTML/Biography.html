									<h3>Faker's History</h3>
                                    <p> He started playing League of Legends in December 2011 when the Korean server opened. Faker initially played normal (casual) games but  soon started to ranked play when the League of Legends matchmaking system could 
										no longer find players of equivalent skill for him to play against. Under the name GoJeonPa he climbed the Korean ladder and became a strong mid-laner, known for his 
										aggressive play and impressive mechanics. This is what started his carrer as a professional League of legends player. </p>
                                    <p> Faker achieved the no. 1 ranking in solo queue and began attracting the attention of several Korean e-sports organisations.
										There were rumours of many offers from prospective teams but Faker decided to join SK Telecom T1 in February 2013 and played on their second team..</p>
